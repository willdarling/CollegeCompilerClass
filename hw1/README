CMSC 22100 Spring 2018 HW1

This archive contains five files:

- sources.cm, a standard Makefile-like file for this group of files,

- check.sig, the Check module signature,

- check.sml, the Check module implementation,

- hw1.sml, a batch of programming exercises, and

- this file.

The Check code is already written.

What *you* should do this week is fill in the unimplemented functions
in the HW1 module.

Please note all unimplemented functions are stubbed out with raised
exceptions. This is The Right Way to deal with yet-to-be-written
code. Never write stub implementations that return imposter values
like 0 or false; these can be the sources of positively insidious
errors later in the development process.

As you're working on the HW1 exercises, you can periodically compile
your work by typing

- CM.make "sources.cm";

from within the SML REPL. As long as the unimplemented functions are
just exception-raisers, as they are given to you, you can compile the
partially-done code, with useful feedback, at any time.

(CM stands for "compilation manager.")

Remember that installing and/or using "rlwrap" with the SML REPL will
make your SML use much more pleasant.
